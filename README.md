# End-to-End LLM App Deployment on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Streamlit, Prometheus & Grafana

#### This repository documents the enterprise-grade deployment of a Large Language Model (LLM) Streamlit application with Prometheus (for metrics) and Grafana (for visualization) on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). 

#### It emphasizes production-ready practices, including TLS with Let's Encrypt, Ingress routing, and Helm-based installations.

#### The deployment uses Docker Hub images, Azure CLI, Kubernetes manifests (.yaml files), and a custom domain registered via Namecheap
