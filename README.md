# End-to-End LLM App Deployment on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Streamlit, Prometheus & Grafana

#### This repository documents the enterprise-grade deployment of a Large Language Model (LLM) Streamlit application with Prometheus (for metrics) and Grafana (for visualization) on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). 

#### It emphasizes production-ready practices, including TLS with Let's Encrypt, Ingress routing, and Helm-based installations.

#### The deployment uses Docker Hub images, Azure CLI, Kubernetes manifests (.yaml files), and a custom domain registered via Namecheap

### Overview ðŸ“Œ 

#### This repository contains a multifunctional Agentic AI workflow built in n8n. The system leverages OpenAI, Pinecone, and Google Calendar to provide enterprise-ready orchestration across two core functions:
    1. Enterprise Data Orchestration
    
        â—¦ Store and retrieve documents from enterprise repositories (e.g., Google Drive) using Pinecone vector storage.
        
        â—¦ Generate OpenAI embeddings for semantic search, knowledge retrieval, and intelligent querying.
        
    2. Event Coordination
        â—¦ Automate scheduling by checking availability in Google Calendar.
        
        â—¦ Create events in confirmed time slots, acting as a smart AI-powered calendar assistant.
